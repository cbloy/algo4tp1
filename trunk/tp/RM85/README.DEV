          RM/COBOL-85 version 5.0 contains the following changes and
          enhancements:

               The behavior of the BEEP phrase on ACCEPT and DISPLAY
               statements has been changed to generate a beep of constant
               frequency and duration regardless of CPU speed.  The
               frequency and duration of the beep has been chosen to
               approximate that generated by DOS when a BEL character is
               sent to the ANSI.SYS driver.

               The verify suite programs have been modified to remove any
               files that they create.  The programs have also been
               modified to generate lower-case file names on UNIX systems.

               When creating files under Novell Netware, the version 5
               runtime system now sets the Shareable File Flag.  This
               allows a created file to be shared with other users
               immediately without using the FLAG utility.  Under earlier
               runtime systems, this option was not set and only one user
               at a time could open a created file.

               When running Novell Netware 2.1 and DOS 3, version 4 and
               earlier runtime systems had a problem forcing data to disk.
               These runtime systems used the DOS Commit File function,
               available under DOS 3 but not supported under any but the
               latest Netware 2.1.  The version 5 runtime system has been
               improved to detect whether the DOS Commit File function is
               implemented.  Under earlier versions of Netware 2.1 it will
               detect that Commit File is not operational and will instead
               close and reopen a file to force data to disk.  This allows
               the data recovery strategies described in Chapter 5 of the
               User's Guide to be effective, and eliminates the possibility
               that a file with a recovery strategy could be marked closed
               even though the data has not yet been written to disk.

               The configuration option Hard-Disk-Letter was available on
               RM/COBOL-85 versions 4 and earlier on the RUN-ATTR
               configuration record.  In RM/COBOL-85 version 5 this has
               been moved to a new RUN-FILES-ATTR configuration record.  If
               you use this option in any configuration file, your file
               must be changed to operate with RM/COBOL-85 version 5.

          The following problems exist in the version 5.0 DOS runtime
          system:

               On all version 5 and earlier RM/COBOL-85 runtime systems, if
               a calling program passes a called program two arguments that
               begin at the same location (either through redefinition or
               because one is a group which contains the other), when the
               called program asks C$CARG for the parameter descriptions,
               it always receives that of the first argument passed.

               The RM/COBOL-85 version 5 runtime systems for DOS and UNIX
               use different algorithms for calculating file region locks.
               These systems cannot interoperate correctly on a network.
               The File-Lock-Limit configuration attribute cannot be used
               to correct this; the algorithms differ in more than just the
               lock limit.
               OS/2 version 1.1 and 1.0 LAN servers place an upper limit of
               7FFFFFFFh on any region which can be locked in a file.  The
               IBM OS/2 LAN Server 1.2 product correctly supports the same
               region lock limit, FFFFFFFFh, as DOS.  If you are attempting
               to use the RM/COBOL-85 version 5 runtime on DOS with an OS/2
               LAN 1.0 or 1.1 server, use the File-Lock-Limit attribute of
               the RUN-FILES-ATTR configuration record to change the lock
               region used by the runtime system.  WARNING:  all runtime
               systems on a network must use the same File-Lock-Limit.  If
               you change the File-Lock-Limit you should probably attach
               the configuration file to a common RUNCOBOL.EXE file to
               ensure that all stations use the same limit.

               Because PC-NFS uses UNIX servers it probably has the same
               region lock limit as UNIX, 7FFFFFFFh.  Use the RUN-FILES-
               ATTR record File-Lock-Limit attribute to change the runtime
               system lock region.  Although this will allow several DOS
               workstations to share a UNIX server through NFS, this is not
               sufficient to allow the DOS workstations to share a file
               with a UNIX runtime system, as described above.

               There is a bug in the Novell Netware XMS and EMS shells,
               versions 3.01 A-D.  This bug causes them to return incorrect
               information for the server name when asked to resolve a file
               name for a file that resides on the server.  Novell's
               recommendation is to use the NET3 or NET4 shells instead of
               the XMS or EMS versions until they release the next version
               of the shell software.  If the flawed Netware Shells are
               used they could cause problems in the RM/COBOL-85 Runtime
               System.  These problems include the possibility of having an
               OPEN statement open a different file than the one specified
               in the SELECT clause.

               MS-DOS versions 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 do not provide a standard
               way to allow a process to open more than 20 files.
               RM/COBOL-85 provides this capability by copying the file
               handle table from the DOS PSP into a larger handle table
               area.  Novell Netware 1.1.1 does not work correctly when
               this has been done, and will possibly cause a "30,06" error.
               An optional patch is available from Ryan McFarland Technical
               Support that avoids the error by not copying the handle
               table.  Of course this will limit each process to 20 open
               files.

               On some early versions of network software, including Novell
               Netware 1.1.1, the RM/COBOL-85 I/O system fails when opening
               a file with a filename longer than eight characters or an
               extension longer than three characters.  If you encounter
               this problem use filenames of eight or fewer characters with
               extensions of three or fewer characters.  If a COBOL program
               specifies a file name with too many characters in the SELECT
               clause you can set an environment variable to override that
               name and avoid the problem without recompiling the program.
               As an example, the RMPATCH utility program uses "PATCHES-
               FILE" as a file name and therefore will need to have an
               environment variable called "PATCHES-FILE" set to an
               alternate name, such as "P-FILE" before it will operate
               correctly on Novell 1.1.1.

               Microsoft Windows allows multiple tasks to be run on a DOS
               system.  This means that it is possible for two RM/COBOL-85
               programs to access the same local file at the same time, and
               for this to work properly RM/COBOL-85 must be able to place
               locks on the file.  To be able to apply locks to a local
               file the DOS SHARE command must be loaded before starting
               Windows.

               To run the RM/COBOL-85 Window Manager under Microsoft
               Windows there are some procedures that must be followed:  1)
               The RM/COBOL-85 Window Manager must not be loaded before
               running Microsoft Windows -- it must be loaded in each
               virtual machine before running a RM/COBOL-85 program.  This
               can be performed automatically by a batch file.  2) The .PIF
               file for running RM/COBOL must be set to allow running in
               background, to retain video memory, and to monitor text
               ports (more details on these options can be found in the
               Microsoft Windows User's Guide).

               When installing the DOS Window Manager, the b option
               controls the size of the request for initial or additional
               window control memory.  At this time the processing of
               additional window control memory is incorrect.  Instead,
               when the window control memory allocated initially is
               exhausted, the Out of Memory  exception status (306) is
               returned.  Increasing the value of the b option will
               increase the amount of memory allocated initially and thus
               delay the occurrence of this error.

               If the f option is specified when loading the DOS Window
               Manager, the BEEP option on DISPLAY statements does not
               work.  The BEEP option on ACCEPT statements does work
               correctly.  The BEEP option on DISPLAY statements works
               correctly when the f option is not used.

               If the f option is specified when loading the DOS Window
               Manager, and the runtime k option is specified when running
               an application with DISPLAY statements but no ACCEPT
               statements, then when the run unit ends the cursor should be
               positioned in the lower left corner of the screen.  Instead
               the cursor is mistakenly restored to the position it had
               when the run unit started.

               The BORDER= keyword in the CONTROL phrase of an ACCEPT or
               DISPLAY statement to affect the video border of CGA and EGA
               monitors may be ineffective when the Pop-Up Window Manager
               is loaded.  If the f option was specified when the Window
               Manager was loaded, the border displayed, if any, may be a
               different color than that requested.  If the f option was
               not specified when the Window Manager was loaded and a
               BORDER= keyword is specified when a window is created or on
               a DISPLAY statement within the created window, the border
               color is not restored when the window is removed.

          The following problems exist when using the version 5.0 of
          RM/COBOL-85 on a Novell NetWare network:

               RM/COBOL-85 products now enforce registration checking on
               Novell networks.  This registration checking is performed
               using server facilities and will be enforced until the
               RM/COBOL product terminates, or the server is aware that the
               client station is no longer connected to the network.  If a
               RM/COBOL-85 product is not properly terminated due to the
               powering off of the client machine or rebooting it, the
               server will not be aware of the absence of the client until
               the client starts the network shell again. This behavior is
               different from the PC-LAN implementation of the registration
               checking where the loss of a client is noticed immediately.
               This could mean that if a client station is running a
               RM/COBOL-85 application on a Novell NetWork and the client
               is turned off and left off overnight, then the RM/COBOL-85
               could remain registered with the network overnight.

          Please note the following errors and omissions in your
          documentation:

               On page 7-143 of the RM/COBOL-85 Language Reference Manual,
               replace the first paragraph describing the record to be made
               available by a Format 1 READ statement after an OPEN or
               START statement with the following two paragraphs:

                    If the file position indicator was positioned by
                    the execution of an OPEN statement, when the
                    PREVIOUS phrase is omitted the first existing
                    record in the file is made available.  If the
                    PREVIOUS phrase is specified, an AT END condition
                    occurs (see below).

                    If the file position indicator was positioned by a
                    START statement and the record indicated by the
                    file position indicator is still accessible
                    through the same access path then the record is
                    made available.  If the record is no longer
                    accessible, which may have been caused by the
                    deletion of the record, the file position
                    indicator is updated to point to the next (or
                    previous) existing record in the file and that
                    record is then made available.

               Page 7-182 of the RM/COBOL-85 Language Reference Manual
               describes the behavior of the START statement as "The file
               position indicator is positioned to the first logical record
               currently existing in the file whose key satisfies the
               comparison."  The correct description is:

               The file position indicator is modified as follows:

                    If the relational operator specifies that the key
                    must be equal to, greater than, or greater than or
                    equal to the data item, then the file position
                    indicator is positioned to the first logical
                    record currently existing in the file whose key
                    satisfies the comparison.

                    If the relational operator specifies that the key
                    must be less than or less than or equal to the
                    data item, then the file position indicator is
                    positioned to the last logical record currently
                    existing in the file whose key satisfies the
                    comparison.

               The RM/COBOL-85 verify suite has been modified to include an
               additional test program for pop-up windows.  The program
               name is wintest and there are several other programs in the
               test suite which it can call.  The wintest program displays
               a self explanatory menu which allows you to test the various
               features of the pop-up window system.  If the window manager
               is not installed, the program displays an appropriate
               message to indicate this condition.

               The Introduction of the RM/COBOL-85 User's Guide discusses
               the Directory Search Sequence.  The following text should be
               added to that discussion:

                    To avoid misleading errors, the user should have
                    read access to every directory in the directory
                    search sequence.  This avoids undesired behavior
                    under Novell Netware.  If a user is not permitted
                    to search a directory, then an open request is
                    denied as a security violation regardless of
                    whether the desired file is present in the
                    directory.  Believing that the security violation
                    occurred on a file present in the directory, the
                    runtime system reports an error without checking
                    for the file in later directories.  This behavior
                    also prevents any new files from being created,
                    because the runtime system examines the directory
                    search sequence before creating new files.

               In the Running chapter of the RM/COBOL-85 User's Guide, the
               section "Installing Pop-Up Windows" does not describe the k
               option.  The k option suppresses the banner normally
               displayed when the window manager is installed.

               The RM/COBOL-85 User's Guides omit a significant requirement
               for using Pop-up Windows.  When creating a window, the
               window control block provided must not be that of an active
               window.  When removing a window, the window control block
               should be the same one used to create the window.

               In the System Considerations Chapter of the RM/COBOL-85
               User's Guide, the first paragraph of the section "Defining
               the Border of the Pop-Up Window" references WCB-BORDER-
               SWITCH and in the subsequent paragraphs references WCB-
               BORDER.  All these references should be WCB-BORDER-SWITCH.

               In the System Considerations chapter of the User's Guide,
               the section "Defining the Border of the Pop-Up Window" omits
               the description of border type 2.  A value of 2 in the WCB-
               BORDER-TYPE field indicates that graphic line draw
               characters be used to paint the border.

               In the RM/COBOL-85 User's Guide, the list of EXCEPTION
               STATUS values for Pop-up Windows is incomplete.  The
               following EXCEPTION STATUS values were omitted:

                    309  Requested REMOVE-WINDOW for inactive WCB
                    310  CREATE-WINDOW requested with active WCB

               The System Considerations chapter of the RM/COBOL-85 User's
               Guide describes the COPY statement as searching for a
               filename with no extension before searching for a filename
               with an extension of .CBL.  This change to the manual is
               incorrect.  The DOS compiler always includes an extension in
               the filename.  If your COPY files on disk do not include an
               extension, an "EXTENSION-NAMES COPY=." configuration record
               should be specified.

               The section "Number of Files" in the System Considerations
               chapter of the User's Guide describes actions needed to
               increase the number of files supported by your system.  When
               running Novell Netware, the Netware shell allows your
               application to open up to 40 files.  If your application
               opens more than 40 files, the shell must be reconfigured.
               To do this, create a file SHELL.CFG and include in it a FILE
               HANDLES = record to increase the maximum number of files.

               The Appendix entitled "RM/COBOL-85 Compared with RM/COBOL
               2.n" of the RM/COBOL-85 User's Guide describes differences
               between RM/COBOL 2.n and RM/COBOL-85, including differences
               on the Incorrect Use of Index-Names.  Omitted from this
               description is the SET ... UP/DOWN BY 0 statement.  RM/COBOL
               2.n accepted this statement, even though it does not comply
               with the COBOL Standard.  RM/COBOL-85 diagnoses this
               statement as an error.  Since the statement accomplishes
               nothing, the resolution is to remove the statement from the
               program.

               In the Utilities appendix of the RM/COBOL-85 User's Guide,
               the exit code returned from recover1 is documented as 0 if
               successful and 1 if unsuccessful.  In addition an exit code
               of 2 is returned if the operator aborts the recovery
               process.
